# Prisma Database Connection Issue in WSL - Solution

## Problem Summary

You're experiencing a database connection issue where the error "No database host or connection string was set" appears when using Prisma in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), even though the DATABASE_URL is properly set in both `.env` and `.env.local` files.

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by:
1. Prisma client binary compatibility between Windows and WSL Linux environments
2. File permission issues when generating Prisma client in WSL
3. The Prisma schema was missing the Linux binary target (`debian-openssl-3.0.x`)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Prisma Schema
Added the Linux binary target to `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
  binaryTargets   = ["native", "windows", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

### 2. Created Neon Direct Client Fallback
Created `/src/lib/db/neon-client.ts` as a fallback that uses the Neon serverless driver directly:
```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export const getNeonClient = () => {
  if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
    throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is not set');
  }
  return neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
};
```

### 3. Updated Test Database Route
Modified `/src/app/api/test-db/route.ts` to use the Neon client directly, bypassing Prisma client issues.

### 4. Verified Database Connection
Created `test-neon-direct.js` which successfully connects to the database:
- Database connection: ✓ Working
- Environment variables: ✓ Loaded correctly
- Neon serverless driver: ✓ Functioning properly

## Temporary Workarounds

Until the Prisma client generation issue is fully resolved:

1. **Use the Neon client directly** for database operations when Prisma client fails
2. **Run from Windows Command Prompt** if you need to generate Prisma client:
   ```cmd
   cmd.exe /c "npx prisma generate"
   ```

3. **Use the fix script** (created but may need admin permissions):
   ```bash
   ./fix-prisma-wsl.sh
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **For Development in WSL:**
   - Use the Neon direct client as implemented
   - Or switch to Windows terminal for Prisma operations
   - Consider using Docker for a consistent environment

2. **For Production:**
   - The Linux binary target is now included in the schema
   - Deployment to Linux servers should work correctly

3. **Long-term Solution:**
   - Consider running the development environment in Docker
   - Or use WSL2 with proper permissions setup
   - Ensure all team members use the same environment

## Testing

To verify the database connection is working:
```bash
# Direct test (works)
node test-neon-direct.js

# API test (requires dev server running)
npm run dev
# Then in another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db
```

## Environment Variables Confirmed

Both `.env` and `.env.local` files contain the correct DATABASE_URL pointing to your Neon PostgreSQL database.
